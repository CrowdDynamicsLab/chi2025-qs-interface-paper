\section{Introduction}

Surveys are a ubiquitous tool for collective decision-making problems. Fundamentally, surveys allow decision-makers to aggregate the opinions of crowds. States utilize referendums to form policy decisions; organizations such as Pew Research Center in the United States deploy surveys to identify public perspectives on societal challenges; and city council meetings provide public forums where community members can voice their concerns and foster consensus. However, to ensure that the signals decision-makers receive are high quality, it is imperative that survey tools accurately capture the attitudes of survey-takers. In the domains of Computer-Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), researchers have explored novel surveying methods that involved rating and ranking of attitudes to gather data and understand collaborative behaviors which informs decisions~\cite{haynesSituatingEvaluationScenarios2004, resnickGroupLensOpenArchitecture1994, pooleConflictManagementGroup1988}.

Quadratic Surveys (QS) have arisen as a promising new survey tool for eliciting survey-taker preferences out of a list of items. In this paper, we define \textbf{Quadratic Surveys (QS)} as a surveying tool that employs the quadratic mechanism~\cite{grovesOptimalAllocationPublic1977}. In QS, participants are given a fixed budget of credits to spend on votes indicating support or opposition for each item. Purchasing $k$ votes for an option in QS expends $k^2$ credits. Because participants are able to allocate multiple votes for or against a particular item, QS fundamentally asks participants to both rank (determine a relative preference) and rate (determine strength of preference) survey items. A recent study in CSCW research demonstrated the benefits of using QS over traditional Likert-scale surveys -- it more accurately reflects individual preferences because the fixed budget forces survey-takers to make trade-offs between different survey items~\cite{chengCanShowWhat2021}. Quadratic Surveys, referred to as Quadratic Voting when used for voting, have been deployed in the wild, both in the public~\cite{rogersColoradoTriedNew2019, teamTaiwanDigitalMinister} and private sectors~\cite{Gov4gitDecentralizedPlatform2023}.  Despite the promise of QS, however, its complexity has limited its practical use. QS takes significantly longer for survey-takers to complete than a corresponding Likert-scale survey, likely due to the difficulties of reasoning around the quadratic vote cost and tradeoff-thinking induced by QS.


%However, there exists no research on designing interfaces for this attitude-capturing tool. In this paper, we introduce~\textbf{Quadratic Surveys (QS)} to describe surveys embedding QV, as explored by~\textcite{quarfoot2017quadratic} and~\textcite{chengCanShowWhat2021}. This study aims to design interactive interfaces for QS with a focus on societal causes. 

The design of attitude-capturing tools is critical as it significantly affects how individuals express their attitudes~\cite{engstrom2020politics, weijtersEffectRatingScale2010, kierujVariationsResponseStyle2010, toepoelSmileysStarsHearts2019, farzandAestheticsEvaluatingResponse2024, xiaoTellMeYourself2020, pielotDidYouMisclick2024}. Better digital interfaces yield higher quality responses, leading to more accurate and reliable collective decision-making. Identifying challenges faced by survey respondents is crucial for improving effectiveness. As Quadratic Surveys inherently produce higher quality responses, the interface should facilitate, not obstruct, this advantageous outcome. Therefore, we ask:~\textit{How can we design interactive interfaces to support participants in completing Quadratic Surveys?}

QS interfaces should help navigate participants in completing the survey due to the congitive load that imposed on them. First, QS requires respondents to construct preferences, a mentally demanding task. Second, QS respondents must express preferences numerically, forcing trade-offs under a budget. 
Since QS adopts the QV mechanism and there are no existing studies on QV interfaces, we turn to preference ocnstruction literature to inform our interface design. As~\textcite{lichtensteinConstructionPreference2006} note, individuals construct preferences in situ when preferences are undefined, necessitating trade-offs or quantifying opinions. \textcite{svensonDifferentiationConsolidationTheory1992} theorized individuals differentiate among options before consolidating a result. We explored ranking, selection, and organization approaches over three design iterations to facilitate preference construction. During our iteration, we learn that survey respondents need not construct a full set of preferences among all options to allocate their credits when completing QS. We then consulted survey response format literature\cite{toepoelSlidersVisualAnalogue2018} to inform our design componenets and included a drag-and-drop for direct interface manipulation for survey respondents.  

Finally, we introduce a novel interactive QS interface (Figure~\ref{fig:interactiveInterface}) that nudges QS survey respondents to take a two-step `organize-then-vote' approach to preference construction and elicitation. The final interface aimed to scaffold the `differentiation and construction' decision-making process from decision making research, supporting the preference construction journey through a two-step approach: first organizing, then voting. Participants are showed all options on the survey one-at-a-time, and guided to categorize them into a three-tiered preference category. Participants can organize their thoughts within the bins as they wish. These categories then inform the position of the voting interface, where survey respondents finally expresses their preferences.

Other then cognitive load imposed from the mechanism itself, long lists of options can cause cognitive overload. Empirical use of QV implementations, such as the Colorado House of Representatives, considered 107 bills in one QV event~\cite{QuadraticVotingColorado}. Psychology literature showed that too many choices can lead to challenges like choice overload and overchoice~\cite{iyengarWhenChoiceDemotivating2000, gourvilleOverchoiceAssortmentType2005}. Increased choices raise cognitive load, leading to more survey response errors and `good enough' answers instead of optimal ones~\cite{lenznerCognitiveBurdenSurvey2010, blessAskingDifficultQuestions1992}. Reducing the number of options can be impractical if the goal is to elicit fine-grained individual preferences for decision makers. This practical challenge addes additional cognitive load challenges to using QS.

With our proposed interface, considering practical use of QS, this research examines the influence of interactive interfaces on QS with varying option lengths. We seek to answer the following research questions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item RQ1. How does the number of options in QS impact respondents' cognitive load?
    \item RQ2a. How does the two-phase interactive interface impact respondents' cognitive load compared to a text interface?
    \item RQ2b. What are the similarities and differences in sources of cognitive load across the two interfaces?
    \item RQ3. What are the differences in QS respondents' behaviors when coping with long lists of options across the two-phase interactive interface and the text interface?
\end{itemize}

To answer these research questions, we designed a 2x2 between-subject in-lab study. Participants completed a QS with either a short or long list of options using our designed text or interactive interface. We measured participants' cognitive load using NASA-TLX and conducted interviews focusing on its different elements. We collected clickstream data as participants completed the QS. We recruited 41 participants from a local community and surveyed their attitudes on various societal issues. We analyzed study results, transcribed, coded, and thematically analyzed interviews.

\paragraph{Contributions}
We contributed to CSCW by proposing the first interactive interface specifically designed for QS and QV-like applications. No prior research has investigated interfaces for QS, especially long ones that lead to cognitive overload. Our two-stage organize-then-vote interface facilitates critical decision making and limits satisficing behaviors. This design promotes incremental updates and deeper engagement, enhancing understanding and decision quality. Second, we conducted the first in-depth qualitative analysis identifying key factors contributing to cognitive load among survey respondents. Our qualitative interviews identified design challenges for QS, driving further research directions.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: related works are covered in section~\ref{sec:relatedWorks}, followed by design decisions for the interactive QS interface~\ref{sec:interfaceDesign}. Section~\ref{sec:experiment} details the experiment design. Study findings are presented in sections~\ref{sec:cog_result}, section~\ref{sec:behave_result}. We discuss our findings and future work in section~\ref{sec:discussion}.

Additionally, we conduct the first in-depth qualitative analysis which identifyed key factors contributing to cognitive load among survey respondents, leading to practical design recommendations. Although our findings did not show statistically significant differences in cognitive load as measured by NASA-TLX, our two-step interactive interface proved effective in facilitating more holistic and reflective decision-making, as evidenced by qualitative interview results. This scaffolding design promotes incremental updates and fosters deeper engagement, ultimately enhancing understanding and decision quality.
