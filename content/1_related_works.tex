\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:relatedWorks}
This research sits at the intersection of three core areas: quadratic surveys, survey and voting interface design, and choice overload and its cognitive challenges. In this section, we review related works in each of these areas.

\subsection{Quadratic Survey and the Quadratic Mechanism}
We introduce the term \textbf{Quadratic Survey (QS)} to describe surveys that use the Quadratic Mechanism to collect individual attitudes. The~\textbf{Quadratic Mechanism} is a theoretical framework designed to encourage truthful revelation of individual preferences through a quadratic cost function~\cite{grovesOptimalAllocationPublic1977}. This framework gained popularity through~\textbf{Quadratic Voting (QV)}, also known as plural voting, which uses a quadratic cost function in a voting framework to facilitate collective decision-making~\cite{lalley2016quadratic}.~\textcite{quarfoot2017quadratic} demonstrated that QV effectively gauges public opinions and mitigates the tyranny of the majority in traditional voting systems. In addition, QV is not subject to Arrow's impossibility theorem, which states that no voting system can perfectly aggregate individual preferences without trade-offs~\cite{morreau2014arrow}, because it does not require aggregating rankings.  

Quadratic Survey (QS) adapts these strengths of the Quadratic Mechanism in \textit{voting} to encourage truthful preference expression in \textit{surveys}. Unlike traditional surveys that elicit either rankings~\textit{or} ratings, QS allows detailed presentations of~\textit{both} by casting multiple votes for or against options, incurring a quadratic cost.~\textcite{chengCanShowWhat2021} showed that this mechanism aligns individual preferences more accurately with their behaviors than Likert Scale surveys, especially in resource-constrained scenarios.

To illustrate how QS works, we formally define the mechanism as follows: Each survey respondent is allocated a fixed budget, denoted as $B$, to distribute among various options. Participants can cast $n$ votes for or against each option~$k$. The cost~$c_k$ for each option $k$ is derived as:

\[c_k = n_k^2 \quad \text{where}\quad n_k \in \mathbb{Z}\]

The total cost of all votes must not exceed the participant's budget:

\[\sum_k c_k \leq B\]

Survey results are determined by summing the total votes for each option:

\[ \text{Total Votes for Option } k = \sum_{i=1}^{S} n_{i,k} \]

where $S$ is the total number of participants, and~$n_{i,k}$ is the number of votes cast by participant~$i$ for option~$k$. Each additional vote for each option increases the marginal cost linearly, encouraging participants to vote proportionally to their level of concern for an issue~\cite{posner2018radical}.

In recent years, empirical studies on QV have expanded to different domains~\cite{naylor2017first, cavailleWhoCaresMeasuring}. Applications based on the quadratic mechanism have also grown, such as Quadratic Funding, which redistributes funds based on outcomes from consensus made using the quadratic mechanism~\cite{buterinFlexibleDesignFunding2019a, freitasQuadraticFundingIncomplete2024}. Recent work by \textcite{southPluralManagement2024} applies the quadratic mechanism to networked authority management, later used in Gov4git~\cite{Gov4gitDecentralizedPlatform2023}. Despite the growth in depth and breadth of applications using the quadratic mechanism, little attention has been given to the user experience and interface design that support individuals in expressing their preference intensity.

\subsection{Survey, Questionnaire, and Voting Design}
The relative lack of research in quadratic mechanism and QS interface design is concerning, as prior research in survey and questionnaire interfaces demonstrated substantial impact on the response and individual's experience on even seemingly minor design decisions. 

Research in the marketing and research community studying survey and questionnaire design, usability, and interactions focuses on understanding the influence of styles and question presentation, or `Response Format,' of a survey or questionnaire. ~\textcite{weijtersExtremityHorizontalVertical2021} demonstrated that horizontal distances between options are more influential than vertical distances, with the latter recommended for reduced bias. Slider bars, which operate on a drag-and-drop principle, show lower mean scores and higher nonresponse rates compared to buttons, indicating they are more prone to bias and difficult to use. In contrast, visual analogue scales that operate on a point-and-click principle perform better~\cite{toepoelSlidersVisualAnalogue2018} These research highlighted outcomes are influenced by the different designs.

Voting interfaces, like surveys and questionnaires, are designed to elicit individual choices except that results can have consequential outcomes. The notorious butterfly ballot~\cite{wandButterflyDidIt2001} is one example of this -- \textcite{wandButterflyDidIt2001} argue that an atypical ballot design may have caused enough accidental votes to swing the 2000 U.S. Presidential Election. Researchers like~\textcite{engstrom2020politics},~\textcite{chisnellDemocracyDesignProblem2016}, and organizations like the Center for Civic Design, which publishes reports like ``Designing Usable Ballots''~\cite{DesigningUsableBallots2015}, stress the importance of ballot design and how it can influence democratic processes. We group this literature into three main categories: designs that shifted voter decisions, designs that influenced human errors, and designs that incorporated technologies to improve usability.

\paragraph{Designs that shifted voter decisions: } For example, states without the option for straight-party ticket voting (the option to circle an option that votes for all the candidates in the same party) exhibited higher rates of split-ticket voting~\cite{engstrom2020politics}. Another example from the Australian ballot with an office block and no party box (having a box that clearly segments the position that the candidates are competing for) has been shown to enhance incumbency advantages.
\paragraph{Designs that influenced errors: } Butterfly ballots increased voter errors because voters could not correctly identify the punch hole on the ballot. Splitting contestants across columns increases the chance for voters to overvote~\cite{quesenberyOpinionGoodDesign2020}. On the other hand, \textcite{everettElectronicVotingMachines2008} showed the use of incorporating physical voting behaviors, like lever voting, into graphical user interfaces.
\paragraph{Designs that incorporated technologies: } Other projects like the Caltech-MIT Voting Technology Project have sparked research to address accessibility challenges, resulting in innovations like EZ Ballot~\cite{leeUniversalDesignBallot2016}, Anywhere Ballot~\cite{summers2014making}, and Prime III~\cite{dawkinsPrimeIIIInnovative2009}. In addition, \textcite{gilbertAnomalyDetectionElectronic2013} investigated optimal touchpoints on voting interfaces, and \textcite{conradElectronicVotingEliminates2009} examined zoomable voting interfaces.

Voting system design and response formats significantly influence behavior, decision accuracy, and cognitive load. Research like~\textcite{galesicDropoutsWebEffects2006} showed that the burden on survey respondents increases dropouts. An effective design would enhance usability and reduce cognitive challenges faced by survey respondents, especially in complex response mechanisms like QS.

\subsection{Cognitive Challenges and Choice Overload}
Despite insights from studies related to the quadratic mechanism, voting, and surveying techniques, the challenge of respondents making difficult decisions when responding using quadratic mechanisms remains unexplored in the literature.~\textcite{lichtensteinConstructionPreference2006} laid out the three key elements that made decisions difficult. They include people making decisions within an unfamiliar context, people forced to make tradeoffs due to conflicts among choices, and people quantifying values for their opinions. QS fits into the description of all three elements, as participants can face options placed by the decision maker that they have never seen before. Participants are bounded by budgets that force them to make tradeoffs, and the final votes are presented in values. Hence, we believe that QS introduces a high cognitive load.

Cognitive overload can adversely affect performance, for instance, causing individuals to rely more on heuristics rather than engaging in deliberate and logical decision-making~\cite{daniel2017thinking}. In addition, some researchers believe that preferences are constructed in situ just like memories. Thus, when too much information is presented to an individual, they can `satisfice' their decisions~\cite{simonBehavioralModelRational1955, payneAdaptiveStrategySelection1988, tverskyJudgmentsRepresentativeness}. This behavior refers to when an individual settles on a `good enough' solution rather than an `optimal' response. This overload can happen when there are too many options. Subsequently, too many options can lead to individuals feeling overloaded, leading to decision paralysis, demotivation, and dissatisfaction~\cite{iyengarWhenChoiceDemotivating2000}.

Additionally,~\textcite{alwinMeasurementValuesSurveys1985} highlighted that the use of ranking techniques in surveys can be time-consuming and potentially more costly to administer. These challenges are compounded when there are numerous items to rank, requiring substantial cognitive sophistication and concentration from survey respondents \cite{featherMeasurementValuesEffects1973}.

Notable applications of Quadratic Voting include the 2019 Colorado House considering 107 bills~\cite{coyNewWayVoting2019} and the 2019 Taiwan Presidential Hackathon~\cite{QuadraticVotingFrontend2022} featuring 136 proposals both featured a single QV question with hundreds of options. Psychological and behavioral research highlights the importance of understanding how individuals navigate and benefit from new interfaces under long-list QS conditions. These empirical uses of QV suggest QS's potential in eliciting individual preferences, highlighting the need to study the cognitive load and interface design.


%As \textcite{chengCanShowWhat2021} noted, it is essential to better understand how the number of options influences the usability of QS and to design interfaces that effectively support survey respondents.
% there is limited research on interfaces for Constant Sum surveys~\cite{hauserIntensityMeasuresConsumer1980a}, a mechanism similar to QS that aims to elicit both ranking and rating preferences from individuals.
%The closest work discussing interfaces for QV is an arXiv paper~\cite{} that transformed the knapsack voting platform developed by \textcite{goelKnapsackVotingVoting}
% While both fields have deep insights into understanding design's influence on attitude elicitation, QS's unique capability of supporting both ranking and rating~\cite{chengCanShowWhat2021} makes designing an interface important and challenging. Subsequently, this research aims to understand how this interface influences an individual's QS response behavior. Requiring the distribution of budgets following the quadratic mechanism introduces new and complex decisions. 
% Empirical studies and applications of the quadratic mechanism and quadratic voting have increased in the past few years. Several studies have explored the empirical use cases for QV, including \textcite{quarfoot2017quadratic}'s study on 4,500 participants' attitudes across ten public policies, highlighting differences between QV and Likert scale survey results. \textcite{chengCanShowWhat2021} applied quadratic surveys in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and subsequently showed QV's effectiveness in reflecting true preferences in monetary decision tasks. \textcite{naylor2017first} used QV in educational research to gauge student opinions on factors affecting university success, and \textcite{cavailleWhoCaresMeasuring} examined QV in polarized choice scenarios.
