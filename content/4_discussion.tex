\section{Discussion and Future Works}
\label{sec:discussion}
This study proposed a two-phase interface for QS to study how the number of survey options and interfaces influence cognitive load and behavior in social resource allotment context. Section~\ref{sec:cog_result} and~\ref{sec:behave_result} revealed that longer surveys did not increase cognitive load, contrary to expectations.

In the discussion section, we interpret results related to cognitive load and survey respondent behaviors. We focus on three key topics: what two-phase interface elements influenced behavior, how these elements supported preference construction, and remaining design challenges. Additionally, we provide recommendations for using QS and suggest design improvements.

We concluded that the two-phase interface prevented satisficing behaviors and promoted more strategic, holistic thinking, unlike the text-based interface, which leans more toward operational tasks. Behavioral analysis showed that long two-phase interface participants made frequent, small updates, shifting their cognitive load focus.

% ========================================%
\subsection{Interpretation of results: Two-phase interface limits satisficing during cognitive overload} \label{sec:satisficing}

Participants using the long two-phase interface reported slightly higher cognitive load compared to those using the long text interface. In comparison, the short two-phase interface resulted in a lower cognitive load. This suggests that the two-phase interface alone does not inherently increase cognitive load.

One explanation is that the two-phase interface reduces cognitive load in the short QS but not in the longer one. In longer surveys, the interactive nature of the two-phase interface may require participants to perform more operations without significantly altering their decision-making processes. However, our findings suggest that participants using the two-phase interface in longer surveys responded more efficiently. Across both short and long surveys, participants using the two-phase interface demonstrated iterative and efficient fine-tuning preferences, indicating deeper survey engagement. Therefore, we reject the claim that the two-phase interface increases cognitive load in the long survey.

An alternative explanation is that while the two-phase interface limits satisficing during cognitive overload, the complexity of the long QS may have counteracted this effect, preventing a full reduction in cognitive load. This suggests that long QS participants resorted to satisficing behaviors to manage their cognitive overload. Qualitative results support this explanation: participants using the two-phase interface engaged in broader, more strategic considerations, while those using the text interface focused on operational tasks. For instance, participants using the long two-phase interface experienced less cognitive burden from precise voting and managed their time better. Overall, the two-phase interface participants demonstrated deeper and more critical thinking, as they engaged in more strategic decision-making.

In contrast, participants using the long text interface satisficed due to cognitive overload from having to decide and allocate more credits for more options. However, fewer participants in this group reported high cognitive load compared to those in the short-text interface. This group also experienced the least temporal demand and frustration with operational tasks, despite spending a similar amount of time per option as participants using the text interface. These counterintuitive findings pointed to the remaining plausible explanation that long-text interface participants used satisficing to manage the overload.

~\textbf{In summary}, the interactive components of the two-phase interface likely prevented mental shortcuts~\cite{daniel2017thinking, simonBehavioralModelRational1955, payneAdaptiveStrategySelection1988, tverskyJudgmentsRepresentativeness}, resulting in a cognitive~\textit{shift} towards deeper reflection and decision-making. Thus, while QS with many options might lead to satisficing, the two-phase interface redirects participants' attention, facilitating the decision-making process that promotes comprehensive preference construction. In the following section, we examine these specific elements that guided participants to achieve this.

% ================================= %
\subsection{Bounded rationality and interface design}
Bounded rationality emerged as a core theme in participants' responses, highlighting how cognitive limitations lead to sub-optimal decision-making due to their inability to process all available information~\cite{simonBehavioralModelRational1955}. This often led to ~\textit{\smash{satisficing}} behaviors, where participants settle for ~\textit{good enough} but not~\textit{optimal} decisions~\cite{gigerenzerReasoningFastFrugal1996}.

For instance, \texttt{S036} described making meaningful choices while acknowledging the limits of their effort:

\begin{displayquote}
~\bracketellipsis you thought of enough things, you know, and so it wasn't the most effort I could put in because again, that would have been diminishing returns. I tried to think of enough things~\bracketellipsis and then move on.~\bracketellipsis 
% I think that that's just not a realistic expectation (to be perfect), but I felt satisfied.~\bracketellipsis 
I felt like that (the response) was satisfied, but not perfect. Cause perfect is not a reality. \hfill\quoteby{S036 (ST)}
\end{displayquote}

This illustrates typical satisficing decision-making, where participants settle for suboptimal choices. In long QS, the significant increase in decision points—due to the numerous vote and credit options—was so overwhelming to some that even features like pre-calculated vote-credit values in drop-down menus provided relief, as they helped avoid the cognitively demanding task of searching for bounds.

Participants often relied on~\textit{\smash{heuristics}}~\cite{tverskyJudgmentUncertaintyHeuristics1974} and~\textit{\smash{defaults}}~\cite{thalerNudgeImprovingDecisions2008a}, behaviors less common among two-phase interface participants. Presenting one option at a time reduced reliance on defaults and encouraged deeper reflection, as illustrated by~\texttt{S013}, who highlighted how the organization phase supported their option preferences construction: 

\begin{displayquote}
\bracketellipsis it (organization phase) gives you time to just focus on that single thing and rank it based on how you feel at that moment. \hfill\quoteby{S013 (SI)}
\end{displayquote}

Conversely, text interface participants, like \texttt{S003}, described how default placements influenced their decisions:

\begin{displayquote}
    Honestly, if medical research~\bracketellipsis was the first one I saw, I think it would automatically give it a lot more. \hfill\quoteby{S003 (ST)}
\end{displayquote}

The three key elements of the organization phase—presenting options one at a time, grouping them into categories, and enabling drag-and-drop—worked together to structure participant preferences. These elements aligned with cognitive strategies like~\textit{\smash{problem decomposition}}~\cite{simonSciencesArtificial1996} and~\textit{\smash{dimension reduction}} which reduces cognitive overload. Bounded rationality illuminates the importance of decision-making support interfaces rather than being a critique of human behaviors. One participant explained how the organization phase broke down complex decisions into manageable steps:

\begin{displayquote}
\bracketellipsis being able to have a preliminary categorization of all the topics. First, it introduced me to all the topics,~\bracketellipsis to think about and process~\bracketellipsis being able to digest all the information prior to actually allocating the budget or completing the quadratic survey. \hfill\quoteby{S009 (LI)}
\end{displayquote}

Participants using the two-phase interface, especially in the long version, organized options along dimensions such as topics (e.g., health vs. humanitarian) and preferences (positive vs. negative) before voting. Others expressed that the upfront introduction of all options and the ability to rank and group them helped manage their cognitive load effectively. In contrast, almost half of the participants using the long text interface, like~\texttt{S028}, expressed a desire for features that can help reduce the decision space when responding to the QS, further supporting the importance of these organizational design elements:

\begin{displayquote}
Because with this many (options), especially when I'm thinking \ldots\ Ok, where was (the option) \ldots\ Where was (the option) you know? Oh, that's right. Maybe I could give another up another upvote to the, you know whatever~\bracketellipsis \hfill\quoteby{S028 (LT)}
\end{displayquote}

This quote reflected participants' need to manually track and revisit options, which occupies cognitive load, without a more structured interface.

~\textbf{In summary}, individual's bounded rationality encouraged participants to exhibit~\textit{\smash{satisficing}} behaviors,~\textit{\smash{heuristics}}, and~\textit{\smash{defaults}} when responding to QS. Showing all options upfront, one at a time, and repositioning options based on participants' rough preferences prevented participants from using defaults and heuristics. The two-phase organization actively scaffolds participants' decision-making process, supporting efficiency \textit{\smash{problem decomposition}} and~\textit{\smash{dimension reduction}}. Together, these elements in the two-phase interface design prevented~\textit{\smash{satisficing}} behaviors and supported participants in making more informed decisions through a more strategic planning and holistic thinking process.

% ============================== %
\subsection{Construction of Preference on QS}

Completing QS is a series of difficult decision tasks~\textcite{lichtensteinConstructionPreference2006}.~\textcite{svensonDifferentiationConsolidationTheory1992}'s differentiation and consolidation theory helps explain how participants process these decisions. The decision process begins with differentiation, where participants identify differences and eliminate less favorable options, followed by consolidation, which strengthens their commitment to selected choices. This theory aligns with how the two-phase interface helps participants decompose options into categories, effectively reducing decision complexity.

Participants started by constructing preferences in situ, especially regarding options they hadn’t previously considered:
\begin{displayquote}
    \bracketellipsis`Oh, there are other aspects that I never care about.' And actually~\ldots some people care <an option>. Sure. Why? Why (should) I spend money on that? \\\hfill\quoteby{S037 (LI)}
\end{displayquote}

Those using the text interface, lacking the interactive tools, found it challenging to facilitate differentiation as~\texttt{S025} noted:

\begin{displayquote}
    I would like to be able to like, click and drag the categories themselves so I could maybe reorder them to like my priorities.~\bracketellipsis make myself categories and subcategories out of this list~\ldots If I could organize it. \hfill\quoteby{S025 (LT)}
\end{displayquote}

In contrast, the two-phase interface allowed participants to express at least one dimension of differentiation more easily. The drag-and-drop feature helped blend this differentiation into the consolidation phase. Not only does participants drag-and-drop options post voting to reflect and assure a correct vote allocation, it also enables participants, like~\texttt{S039}, to make fine-grain comparisons between options:

\begin{displayquote}
    I think the system was actually really helpful because I could just drag them.~\bracketellipsis I can really compare them, I can drag this one up here, and then compare it to the top one~\bracketellipsis \hfill\quoteby{S039 (SI)}
\end{displayquote}

The bi-modal behavior observed in the long interactive interface participants provided in the results aligns with the differentiation and consolidation framework. Participants in the two-phase interface began differentiating options earlier allowing them to later adjust fine-grain votes. The faster and smaller vote updates indicated participants consolidating. The less prominent bi-modal behavior from the long text interface participants implied that the interface guided this decision framework as participant~\texttt{037} explained:

\begin{displayquote}
    I only start from the positive one~\bracketellipsis I finish everything~\ldots and then I move to the second part (the neutral box).~\bracketellipsis I want to focus on these and make sure that resources are at least they get the attention they want. And if there's surplus and they can move to the second part. \hfill\quoteby{S037 (LI)}
\end{displayquote}

These evidences explain how the organization phase and the drag-and-drop features supported differentiation and consolidation, scaffolding a decision-making framework enabling deeper engagement.

\textbf{In summary}, participants construct their preferences as they complete QS. We observed behaviors and qualitative insights that align with the differentiation and consolidation theory in decision-making. Our interface scaffolded many of the differentiation stages through pre-voting organization and some consolidation phases through drag-and-drop, explaining how the two-phase approach supports preference construction to yield effective QS responses.

% ========================= %
\subsection{Opportunities for better budget management}
Budget management is a recurring theme in participant interviews. While they appreciated the automatic calculation feature in modern QV interfaces, we identified three challenges for future QS interfaces: ~\textit{cognitive load},~\textit{the cold-start problem}, and~\textit{navigating between budget, votes, and outcome}.

\subsubsection{Automatic calculation is critical}
Over one-third of participants ($N=14$) from all four experiment conditions emphasized the importance of automated calculation for deriving costs and tracking expenditures. For example:

% \begin{displayquote}
% I really like having the costs of all the votes displayed. When you select the dropdown menu and ranked in order. \hfill\quoteby{S002 (SI, deriving cost)}
% \end{displayquote}

\begin{displayquote}
I thought I have \bracketellipsis (to) do all the numbers or calculations myself as a part of checking my ability of doing mathematics. \bracketellipsis I said that credit summary to be very specific. The credit summary section was really wonderful in doing all the calculations on that end. \hfill\quoteby{S005 (LT, keeping track of spent)}
\end{displayquote}

The quotes marked the importance that QS must be facilitated by computer-supported interfaces.

% \subsubsection{Cognitive load from budget management}
% Cognitive load results revealed participants suffered from budget management. Behavioral economists like~\textcite{Shah2015a} believe that values and careful decision-making are derived from limited resources, which introduce a higher cognitive load. Prospect theory~\cite{kahnemanProspectTheoryAnalysis1979} highlights the higher negative value of \textit{perceived} utility when cuts must be made. This evidence underscores the heightened cognitive load participants experience when managing their budgets. Our interface lacks tools to mitigate this, making it a crucial area for future work.

\subsubsection{The coldstart problem}
We notice from the study that one of the biggest challenges for participants is deciding 'how many votes' to start with. This challenge pertains to the initial vote, not the relative vote. Some participants began by equally distributing their credits to all options and then made adjustments. Others established $1$, $2$, and $3$ votes as starting points. A small handful surprisingly used the tutorial's example of 4 upvotes as their anchor.

This arbitrary voting decision echoes discussions in prior literature about the existence of an absolute value for individuals. Coherent arbitrariness~\cite{arielyCoherentArbitrarinessStable2003}, similar to the anchoring effect in marketing, refers to participants' willingness to allocate votes, which can be influenced by an arbitrary value. However, the ordinal utility remains intact among the set of preferences.

% This challenge remains an open question, and future research can explore possibilities to scale ordinal utility to map it to individual preferences without biasing participants.

\subsubsection{Navigating Between Budget, Votes, and Actual Impact}
The third challenge is participants' confusion between budget, votes, and outcomes, despite understanding their definitions. One participant stated:

\begin{displayquote}

~\bracketellipsis get rid of the upvote column or just get rid of the word upvote and just really focus on the money column. Listen. You're an organization or your participant. You have X amount of dollars you need to. You can only distribute X amount of dollars to these causes. So you have to figure out which ones get the most, which ones don't get as much.~\bracketellipsis 

Interviewer: ~\bracketellipsis Do you feel that the more votes you're giving to a cause you're actually spending more on it?

Yeah. \hfill\quoteby{S003 (ST)}
\end{displayquote}
Participants like \texttt{S003} bypassed the quadratic formulation, directly translating votes to resource allocation. While this does not invalidate the power of the quadratic mechanism, it causes frustration and friction for participants to construct a clear picture of how to make voting decisions. Future interfaces should better communicate these relationships to facilitate respondents' trade-offs.

\textbf{In summary}, while the interface supports budget management through automated cost calculation, participants still face cognitive load from managing the budget. The cold-start problem and the confusion between budget, votes, and actual impact are open questions for future research. These challenges highlight the need for better budget management support to complete the QS interface.

\subsection{Quadratic Survey Usage, Design Recommendations and Future Work}
With a deeper understanding of how survey respondents interact with QS and the sources of cognitive load, we recognize that while this current interface may not significantly reduce cognitive load, it represents a crucial step toward constructing better interfaces to support individuals responding to QS. In this subsection, we outline usage and design recommendations applicable to all applications using the quadratic mechanism and highlight directions for future work.

\subsubsection{Usage Recommendation: QS for Critical Evaluations}
Our study highlighted the complex cognitive challenges and in-depth consideration required when ranking and rating options using QS, even in a short survey. Similar to survey respondents needing to make trade-offs across options, researchers and agencies seeking additional insights and alignment with respondent preferences must ensure that survey respondents have the cognitive capacity to complete such surveys rigorously. QS should be designed for critical evaluations, such as investment decisions, or situations where participants have ample time to think and process the survey. For instance, revealing the options ahead of time can aid in preference construction.

\subsubsection{Design Recommendations}
\paragraph{Use Organization Phases for Quadratic Mechanism Applications}
Our study demonstrated that preference construction can shift from operational to strategic and higher-level causes. An additional organizational phase with direct manipulation capability allows survey respondents to engage in higher-level critical thinking. We believe this approach should extend beyond QS to other ranking-based surveying tools, such as rank-choice voting and constant sum surveys. Further research should examine how implementing such functionality alters survey respondents' mental models.

\paragraph{Facilitate Differentiation through Categorization, Not Ranking}
Participants in our study were less inclined to provide a full rank unless necessary. The final 'rank' of option preferences often emerged as a byproduct of their vote allocation, constructed in situ. Therefore, for survey designs to be effective in constructing preferences, it is more important to facilitate differentiation than to focus on direct manipulation solely for fine-tuning. Emphasizing categorization can better support participants in articulating their preferences.

\subsubsection{Future Work: Support for Absolute Credit Decision}
Deciding the absolute amount of credits in QS is highly demanding. Designing interfaces and interactions that address the cold start challenge and help participants decide the absolute vote value while considering ways to limit direct influences remains an open question. Future research should explore innovative solutions to support participants in making these complex decisions effectively.

By implementing these recommendations and pursuing future research directions, we can improve the usability and effectiveness of QS and other quadratic mechanism-powered applications, ultimately aiding respondents in making more informed and accurate decisions.

\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}
Evaluating the QS interface is challenging due to its novelty. During the study, we identified several limitations that require further research.

\paragraph{Understanding results influence on decision-makers}
Further research is required to understand how the QS interface impacts decision-makers and broader societal resource distributions. Since QS is still in its early stages, we prioritize its widespread adoption and usage before attempting a comprehensive assessment of its influence on decision-making. Future studies will examine how decision-makers interpret and use QS data, as well as its broader implications for societal decisions.

\paragraph{Individual differences in cognitive capacity}
Variations in individual cognitive capacity influenced participants' cognitive scores. For example, participants with more experience in decision-making might be able to manage multiple options more effectively. A within-subject study could clarify cognitive load shifts, but deconstructing established preferences and altering options further complicates this. Thus, we opted for this in-depth, between-subject study, although the small sample size may introduce noise that distorts the actual cognitive load. Future research should quantify the impact of different QS interfaces.

\paragraph{Limited experience with QS}
Participants had no prior experience with the QS interface. Following a tutorial and quiz, participants proceeded to complete tasks using the QS interface. While participants understood the QS mechanics, familiarity with the interface still influences strategies and cognitive load. As quadratic mechanisms become more prevalent, future research can compare novices and experts.

\paragraph{Duration between clicks to represent decision-making}
Click duration may include time spent considering other options, so it must be treated as an approximate measure of decision-making time. For instance, deciding between two options may take longer for the first option and less time for the second. Despite its limitations, this approach provides valuable insights into decision-making within our experimental constraints.

% Recall that this survey aims to assist community organizers in distributing resources to a societal cause. This participant decided to `skip' over the quadratic formulation and the concept that their votes are governed by the quadratic formulation, drawing a direct translation between votes and the resources to which community organizers ought to contribute.

%  of well-organized interfaces in managing cognitive load.

% Participants ($N=4$, $2$ using the long two-phase interface) mentioned that organization support helped them to allot the intensity of votes by helping them focus and prioritize options through ranking. This exercise allows them to follow a clear decision-making process that avoids confusion.
% It is important to note that bounded rationality does not critique or exploit biases, but emphasizes the importance of designing interfaces that prevent decisions which diverge from one's true preferences. For example,~\underline{\smash{problem decomposition}}~\cite{simonSciencesArtificial1996} and~\underline{\smash{dimension reduction}} are strategic approaches to managing cognitive overload. Several participants would create a two-axis grouping, regardless of their experiment group. Participants clustered topics (e.g., health vs. humanitarian) and preferences (positive vs. negative). The difference between conditions was whether these groupings were representable on the interface.
% In addition, results indicate long text interface participants were satisfied due to cognitive overload from having too many options. They have to read more text, allocate more credits, and consider more options. Section~\ref{sec:cog_result} and Section~\ref{sec:behave_result} show how counterintuitive that this group had fewer participants experiencing high cognitive load compared to the short text interface. This group also experienced the least temporal demand (Sec.~\ref{sec:temporal}) while showing no difference in time spent per option compared to the text interface (Figure~\ref{fig:vote_time}). Participants in the long text interface also expressed the least frustration with operational tasks (Sec~\ref{sec:frustration}). 
% % These participants engaged with higher-level strategic challenges, in contrast to the more operational tasks emphasized in the text interface. 
% \paragraph{Familarity to the options}
% 1. primed on the local community, 
% 2. limited experience with qs
% We also acknowledge the possibility that the elicited values are pure noise and do not reflect the actual cognitive load. This could be due to the small sample size, the nature of the task, or the participants' understanding of the cognitive load scale. While this true for small sample sizes, we believe that the qualitative insights from the interviews provide a more nuanced understanding of the cognitive load sources. We detail limitations in Section~\ref{sec:limitations}.
% Maybe large scale AB testing and within subject testing in periodic collective decsion making enviornments.
% 3. time associated with the option.

% \subsection{The Quadratic Mechanism is Challenging}
% % We know QV is accurate and that QM allows specific expression of preferences
% % However, QM is diffucult to manage, internally construction of preference is diffuclt but so is the QM.

% % we tried to scaffold the construction of preference in interface design, for which we did help participants get to the exact values faster, but identifying and managing the construction is not something organization interfaces can fully support
% Most challenges participants faced come from the task itself: deciding the number of votes/credits to allot. I created the following hierarchical theme
% CI_3: deciding number of votes and credits (N=9/40, v1:1; v2:1; v3:4; v4:3)
% We can see participants in the long version group struggles more with this challenge. (2/20 vs. 7/20). So what exactly contributes to this decision process? We broke it down to the following themes:

% % Challenge lies in the mechanism itself
% CI_1: working with the QS mechanism (N=6, v1:5; v3:1)
% distinguishing between credits and votes (v3 participant)
% quadratic mechanism (all the rest)
% The first finding is that non of the interactive interface groups (v2 and v4) expressed feeling challenged due to the QS mechanism. The second finding is that the majority of this challenge comes from the short-list group. I think an explanation to this is clearer when we put up the second theme:

% CI_2: use up the remaining credits (N=4, v1:3, v2:1)
% The participants is struggling to express specific level of preference with limited credits. 
% Revisit one of the quotes from CI_1:
% “I wish I could just put the $2 towards the museum, or something like that.” (S036,v1)
% “It would be nice if I can use that one credit if there is an option, because the way it is done is in quadratic...I don't know why that is there...but if there is an option to not have it, and just [inaudible], that would be awesome.” (S012, v1)
% In other words, the expressiveness is constraint by the limited credit, amplified by the quadratic nature, forcing participants to forgo unused credits. This is also likey tied to prospect theory, that we will discuss later.
% The interface in the second group could have eliminated this because some options were eliminated, or that some ranking were established, prior to the voting process.

% We first show that participants constructed their preferences in situ. While some participants had existing preferences (e.g., environmental issues are important), they needed to reconsider aspects of the options or map them to their beliefs.

% \begin{displayquote}

% ~\bracketellipsis the other part of the mental demanding was probably trying to associate with (what) I'm concerned in soci(ety)~\bracketellipsis is that question able to deal with my social concerns like, for example, climate change~\bracketellipsis How does that fit in?

% Behavior analysis in section~\ref{res:act} of participants using the long text and interactive interfaces revealed that they made small adjustments on the votes, clustered toward budget depiction with lesser time spent. These fine-grain adjustments indicated that participants are making less ad-hoc decisions; rather, they are deciding how to better utilize the remainder of the budget when the budget runs low. We identified a bi-modal interaction pattern.

% Conversely, in the text interface, one participant proactively mentioned a request to add click-and-drag functionalities to the interface. The participant described such function to group by topic categorization and also priority placement through direct manipulation.


% Throughout the preference construction journey, we confirm that the two-stage interactive interface and the direct manipulation through drag-and-drop facilitated participants in constructing and reflecting on their preferences, adhering to preference construction theory.

% Additionally, several participants mentioned how the direct manipulation functionality, allowing individuals to drag and drop options for repositioning, supports their reflective thinking during preference construction. One participant noted:
% \begin{displayquote}

% into these categories, making completing the entire QS a series of difficult decisions.
% Literature from~\textcite{lichtensteinConstructionPreference2006} identifies three types of difficult decision-making scenarios: when one's preferences are not clearly defined, necessitating trade-offs, or quantifying opinions.  
% Since the interface supported some participants in managing their limited cognitive ability to make decisions, as shown in the previous subsection, we argue that the interactive interface \textit{shifted} the cognitive focus onto contributing to more in-depth preference construction and fine-tuning, even if it did not significantly reduce the cognitive load. Here we provide more evidence.
