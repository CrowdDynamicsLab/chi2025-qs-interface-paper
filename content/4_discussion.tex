% participant constructing preferences in situ, leave this in discussion
% Ti-Chung Cheng: You mean any other challenges? [Challenges]
% S037: Other than the ones that you've mentioned.
% Ti-Chung Cheng: I mean, it's not necessarily a challenge, but it's interesting to see. Oh, there are other aspects that I never care about. And actually some people care like…Jewish. Sure. Why? Why do I spend money on that? That's the first thought that comes to mind.
% S037: Okay, so any other challenges?
% Ti-Chung Cheng: Not really.

% S037: Okay. So how does a software interface support you or hinder you from expressing your preferences on responding to these societal issues?
% Ti-Chung Cheng: [inaudible] I don't really know if that kinda shifts my behavioral or perspective when sorting this. Oh, but I do feel that when we were sorting, you know, into different basket. Umm…we only see one flash flashcard. We click, and then it drops. Originally, I was thinking, you know, I have a whole bunch of cards right in front of me, and I got to, you know, mix a match. Yeah, I mean, we can do that afterwards. But I think that definitely. tet me think on its own. You know, when I look at medical research re-research. It really based on my initial impression on this item. Instead of, you know. relatively comparing medical research comparing to education policy, which one is more important which one deserves to go to the important basket. I’m not sure if that deteriorates my judgment? Or that kinda helps? But that definitely affects something.
