\section{Conclusion}
In this study, we proposed a novel interface for quadratic surveys and studied the cognitive load of survey respondents when using this interface or not across a short and long survey. Our results highlighted that while the introduction or organization phase before conducting the survey did not reduce cognitive load significantly, participants' behaviors had shifted with more engaging and higher-level considerations. We believe that the interactive interface is critical for survey respondents.
