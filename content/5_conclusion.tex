\section{Conclusion}
This study introduces and evaluates a two-phase ``Organize-then-Vote" interface to help Quadratic Survey (QS) respondents construct their preferences. We examined how the interface affected cognitive load and response behaviors across societal issues of varying lengths through in-lab study, NASA-TLX and interviews. The interfaceâ€™s organization and voting phases, designed to reduce cognitive overload by structuring the decision-making process, allowed respondents to differentiate between options before voting. \change{Results revealed that the two-phase design reduced participant's edit distance between vote adjustments throughout the survey despite spending more time per option. Qualitative insights highlighted two-phase interface  encouraged more iterative and reflective preference construction and it's potential at reducing satisficing behaviors even though it did not clearly reduce overall cognitive load for the longer QS. Nonetheless, this design shift promoted deeper engagement and strategic thinking compared to the text-based interface, by distributing cognitive effort more effectively.} By integrating the organization and drag-and-drop functions, the interface facilitated both preference differentiation and consolidation, making it easier for respondents to refine their decisions. This two-phase interface design supports the development of future software tools that facilitate preference construction and promote the broader adoption of Quadratic Surveys. Future research should explore how to better support individuals in deciding the allocation of budget and design interfaces for smaller devices.
