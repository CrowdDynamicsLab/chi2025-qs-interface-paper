\section{Voting Interface Breakdown}\label{apdx:relatedVoting}
Compared to digital survey interfaces, there exists a rich literature on voting interfaces, which we argue is a special type of survey interface. We categorize these related works into three main categories detailed below:

\paragraph{Designs that shifted voter decisions: } For example, states without straight-party ticket voting~(where voters can select all candidates from one party through a single choice) exhibited higher rates of split-ticket voting~\cite{engstrom2020politics}. Another example from the Australian ballot showing incumbency advantages is where candidates are listed by the office they are running for, with no party labels or boxes.
\paragraph{Designs that influenced errors: } Butterfly ballots increased voter errors because voters could not correctly identify the punch hole on the ballot. Splitting contestants across columns increases the chance for voters to overvote~\cite{quesenberyOpinionGoodDesign2020}. On the other hand, \textcite{everettElectronicVotingMachines2008} showed the use of incorporating physical voting behaviors, like lever voting, into graphical user interfaces.

\paragraph{Designs that incorporated technologies: } Other projects like the Caltech-MIT Voting Technology Project have sparked research to address accessibility challenges, resulting in innovations like EZ Ballot~\cite{leeUniversalDesignBallot2016}, Anywhere Ballot~\cite{summers2014making}, and Prime III~\cite{dawkinsPrimeIIIInnovative2009}. In addition, \textcite{gilbertAnomalyDetectionElectronic2013} investigated optimal touchpoints on voting interfaces, and \textcite{conradElectronicVotingEliminates2009} examined zoomable voting interfaces.

\section{Interface design process}\label{apdx:design}
In this section, we outline the design process leading to our final interface. As mentioned in the paper, our design iteration began from existing QV applications in the wild.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Prototype 1: Ranking-Vote}
Considering that relative preference is often through ranking items, we tested whether ranking options before voting would help establish an individual's relative preference in our prototype 1. This prototype allowed respondents to reposition options before voting. Pretests revealed that respondents rarely moved the options and questioned the necessity of full ranking, as it did not influence their QS submission. Additionally, many were unaware that options were draggable until shown. This insight indicates that full ranking is unnecessary for establishing relative preferences. Therefore, we decided to ask respondents to select a subset of options instead of requiring a full rank among all options.

    \Description{A web interface showing a survey titled "What societal issues need more support?" The interface presents several societal issues in a list format, each with buttons labeled "+1 rating" and "-1 rating" to adjust the ratings. For example, the issue "Pets and Animals" shows a rating cost of \$9 with a +3 rating, and "Human Services" shows a rating cost of \$16 with a +4 rating. The remaining issues include Arts, Culture, Humanities, Education, Environment, and Health, each with their respective ratings and costs. At the bottom of the page is a summary box displaying the total spent (\$73) and the remaining balance (\$251). A "Submit" button is positioned below the summary.}

Important options are placed at the top of the list for voting shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:qv_select_vote}, but options can be placed anywhere on the list if desired. The rest of the controls remain the same as the previous prototype.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Prototype 2: Select-then-Vote}
Based on feedback from Prototype 1, instead of \textit{allowing} individuals to rank options, Prototype 2 implemented a two-phase process that \textit{intentionally} asks respondents to select options to express opinions before voting. As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:qv_select}, survey respondents selected their preferred options (Figure~\ref{fig:qv_select_selection}), and the interface positioned these options at the top of the list for voting (Figure~\ref{fig:qv_select_vote}). We identified several issues during the prototype 2 pretest: many respondents marked most options as 'options they care about,' which undermined the design's purpose. Additionally, the lack of clear distinction between selected and unselected options confused respondents about the necessity of Step 1. Thus, we need a clearer distinction and connection between the two phases to effectively construct relative preferences.

For example, "Pets and Animals" has a rating cost of \$4 with a +2 rating, while "Health" has a rating cost of \$49 with a +7 rating.

A summary section shows the total spent and remaining budget.}


    \label{fig:qv_org}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Prototype 3: Organize-then-Vote}
Figure~\ref{fig:qv_org} shows the last prototype where we built on the previous takeaway by providing finer-grain groupings and creating a clear connection between option organization and voting position. Specifically, we provided three categories: Lean Positive, Lean Negative, and Lean Neutral. Initially, respondents see all options under the section labeled 'I don't know,' which includes only the option descriptions. We ask respondents to move these options into the categories below. Voting controls and information appear on each option once respondents move to the subsequent page, forming a clear connection between option groups, positions, and voting controls.

Feedback indicated that survey respondents are comfortable with the two-phase organize-then-vote design, demonstrating it as a central strategy for our interface development. However, several areas for enhancement were identified: First, the dragging and dropping mechanism in the organization phase is cumbersome and may inadvertently suggest a ranking process, contrary to our intentions. Second, placing unorganized options at the top of the voting list is counterintuitive. Third, the voting controls are disconnected from the option summaries, dividing attention between the left and right sides of the screen. These insights guided refinements in the final two-phase interface, adhering to the two-phase organize-then-vote design framework.

\section{Detailed Qualitative Cognitive Load Breakdown}
\label{apdx:cog_qual}

In addition to the discussion on cognitive load sources presented in the main text, we provide additional details on the six cognitive dimensions. Among all dimensions, we also provide the codes representing different types of demand in a table form. The shaded cells represent the percentage of participants citing each source of mental demand, allowing for comparison within columns. The abbreviations in the columns: ST (Short Text Interface), SP (Short Two-phase Interface), LT (Long Text Interface), and LP (Long Two-phase Interface). Short and Long refer to the sum across both interfaces; Text and Inter refer to the sum across both survey lengths. We include Sparklines for comparisons across these experiment groups.

\section{Sources of Mental Demand}
\label{apdx:mental}
Table~\ref{apdx:mental_table} lists all the mental demand codes.

\label{apdx:mental_table}
\begin{table}[ht!]
   \caption{This table lists all the causes participants mentioned as contributing to their Mental Demand.}
   \Description{A table presenting mental demand across categories such as Budget Management (track credits, maximize usage), Preference Construction (prioritization, resource allocation), and Demand from Experiment Setup. Sparklines and percentage bars are used to visually represent the data across four interface versions (ST, SI, LT, LI) and experiment conditions (Short, Long, Text, Inter). The bars show higher mental demand in areas like Budget Management and Preference Construction, with trends highlighted by sparklines. Additional categories, such as External Factors and Demand due to Interface, are also represented with percentage bars.}

    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{content/image/cog/mental_table.png}
\end{table}

\subsection{Sources of Physical Demand} 
\label{apdx:physical}
Physical demand refers to the physical effort required to complete a task, such as physical exertion or movement. Most participants reported minimal physical demand~($N=32$), reflected in the low NASA-TLX physical demand scores~(Figure~\ref{apdxfig:physical_cog_score}). Notably, $11$ out of $20$ participants who used the two-phase interface mentioned physical demand from using the mouse, reflecting their increased interaction with the interface. This is further supported by the raw NASA-TLX physical demand scores~(Figure~\ref{apdxfig:physical_cog_score}), which show a significant visual difference between short and long two-phase interfaces as well as between text and two-phase interfaces in long surveys. Table~\ref{apdx:physical_table} presents all the relevant codes across experiment groups.


\begin{table}[h]
    \caption{Physical Demand Causes: Most participants expressed little or no physical demand. Results reflected that participants in the long two-phase interface required more actions, hence the higher mention of mouse usage as a source.}
    \Description{A table showing physical challenges experienced by participants, including Reading, Mouse, Vertical Screen, and None/Little physical effort, with sparklines and percentage bars visualizing the data trends. Data is split across four interface versions (ST, SI, LT, LI) and experiment conditions (Short, Long, Text, Inter). The Mouse category has the highest counts, with trends clearly visible via sparklines and bars, while Reading and Vertical Screen challenges have lower values. The None/Little row shows participants reporting minimal physical effort with percentage bars illustrating the distribution.}

The y-axis represents the raw score ranging from 0 to 100. The box plots include individual data points, a central line for the median, and whiskers indicating the 95\% confidence interval. The Short Text, Short 2-Phase, and Long Text interfaces show minimal physical demand, with scores clustered below 20. The Long 2-Phase interface exhibits higher physical demand, with a few scores scattered up to around 60.}

%\vspace{5pt}
% \begin{tldrbox}
%    \faKey~\textbf{Key Differences:} First, participants in the text interface associated effort with operational tasks more often than participants from the two-phase interface. Conversely, participants in the two-phase interface cited more sources from strategic planning than those in the text interface. We observed that participants experienced effort when considering a comprehensive view while using the two-phase interface.
   
%    %Effort sources varied between operational~\textit{Operational Tasks} and~\textit{Strategic Planning}. Participants using the text interface focused on operational tasks, while those using the two-phase interface engaged in strategic planning. This shows that the two-phase interface spurs deeper, more critical thinking.
% \end{tldrbox}

\subsection{Source of Effort}
\label{apdx:effort}
Effort refers to how hard participants felt they worked to achieve the level of performance they did. Since effort includes both mental and physical resource intensity, refer to \Cref{sec:mental} and \Cref{apdx:physical} for definitions. Raw NASA-TLX effort scores~(Figure~\ref{apdxfig:effort_cog_score}) showed a similar spread across experiment groups, the qualitative analysis showed more distinction that participants using the two-phase interface considered options more comprehensively and felt less effort on completing operational tasks, similar to what we found on mental demands~(Section \ref{sec:mental}). Table~\ref{apdx:effort_table} contains codes.

\subsubsection{Effort Source \#1: Operational Tasks} $14$ of the $20$ participants using the text interface mentioned Operational Tasks as effort sources, compared to $7$ using the two-phase interface, with the lowest mention by the long two-phase interface group~($N=2$). Quotes below illustrated participants putting in effort to manipulate the interface.
\begin{displayquote}
I wanted to bump up~(an option) maybe to 4 or <option> to 5 and realize I couldn't.~\bracketellipsis that would be effort came in of how do I want to really rearrange this to make it~(the budget spending) maximize?

\noindent \hfill -- S029, short text interface
\end{displayquote}
\begin{displayquote}
So it was like it was very~\ldots I have to put a lot of effort in terms of you know~\ldots think about each dimension that if I give one credit to <option name> whether it will affect my credits on <another option name>. \noindent\hfill -- S005, long text interface
\end{displayquote}

\subsubsection{Effort Source \#2: Strategic Planning} Different from Operational Tasks, $11$ participants in the text interface compared to $17$ participants described strategic planning as sources of effort, with almost all participants~($N=9$) from the long two-phase interface. We further categorize strategic planning into \textit{narrow} and \textit{broad} scopes as we did for mental demand~\cref{sec:mental}. Participants using the two-phase interface~($N=7$) had nearly mentioned double~($N=4$) times regarding global strategies. For example:

\begin{displayquote}
And really the bulk of the effort was how to rank order these~(options) and allocate the resources behind the upvotes so that I can accurately depict what I want~\ldots say, a committee to focus on and allocate actual fungible resources, too. \noindent \hfill -- S019, long two-phase interface
\end{displayquote}


% However, qualitative analysis revealed that participants using the text interface experienced more effort focused on operational tasks~(i.e., completing specific tasks). In contrast, participants using the two-phase interface experienced more effort focused on strategic planning~(planning a strategy to complete tasks). Specifically, those using the two-phase interface engaged in global strategic planning, considering options comprehensively and beyond the immediate task. This contrasts with text interface participants, who concentrated more on operational tasks and narrower strategic planning. This finding reinforces that cognitive load sources differ between interfaces, with two-phase interfaces fostering deeper, more critical thinking.

%Both examples show considerations beyond personal experiences, including outcomes or social values. Nearly twice as many participants using the two-phase interface~($N=7$) mentioned global strategic efforts compared to the text interface~($N=4$). Overall, more participants using the two-phase interface~($N=17$) reported sources of strategic effort compared to those using text-based interfaces~($N=11$).

%\subsubsection{Takeaway: Two-phase interface spurs more strategic effort from participants}
%Effort is a realization of mental demand through physical actions. Since participants experienced little physical demand, the sources of effort reflected how individuals translated their mental demand into efforts. The raw NASA-TLX effort scores~(Figure~\ref{fig:effort_cog_score}) showed a similar spread across experiment groups, akin to mental demand. However, qualitative analysis revealed that participants using the text interface experienced more effort focused on operational tasks~(i.e., completing specific tasks). In contrast, participants using the two-phase interface experienced more effort focused on strategic planning~(planning a strategy to complete tasks). Specifically, those using the two-phase interface engaged in global strategic planning, considering options comprehensively and beyond the immediate task. This contrasts with text interface participants, who concentrated more on operational tasks and narrower strategic planning. This finding reinforces that cognitive load sources differ between interfaces, with two-phase interfaces fostering deeper, more critical thinking.

%\subsubsection{Effort Source: Strategic Planning}
%Strategic planning is similar to strategic budget management mentioned under mental demand. Unlike operational tasks, strategic planning involves higher-level strategies to complete the survey. We categorize two distinct types of planning: \textit{personal} and \textit{global}. \textit{Personal strategic planning} involves translating preferences onto the survey without considering broader values or beliefs. For example:

%\begin{displayquote}
%~\bracketellipsis having that prior experience and being able to quickly link it to a tangible thing that I've experienced in my personal life.

%\noindent \hfill -- S032, short text interface
%\end{displayquote}

%\begin{displayquote}
%And really the bulk of the effort was how to rank order these~(options) and allocate the resources behind the upvotes so that I can accurately depict what I want~\ldots say, a committee to focus on and allocate actual fungible resources, too. 

%\noindent \hfill -- S019, long two-phase interface
%\end{displayquote}

%Participants using the two-phase interface~($N=13$) mentioned personal strategic planning slightly more than those using the text interface%\end{displayquote}

%\begin{displayquote}
%Hey, even though I don't really like this idea. But what if they're important? They sort of kind of deserve some attention~\ldots that's why I think I have the effort here.

\subsection{Source from Performance}
\label{apdx:performance}

Performance refers to a person's perception of their success in completing a task. Lower values mean good perceived performance; higher values mean poor perceived performance. We found minimal qualitative differences between experiment groups regarding factors influencing perceived performance. Two influencing factors emerged: \textit{Operational Actions} and \textit{Social Responsibility}. Despite most participants reporting positively on their performance, nuances exist in how different groups interpret their performance.

The performance scores appear relatively low across all conditions, with medians hovering between 20 and 40.}

\subsubsection{Operational Actions}
Operational actions, like the theme presented in temporal demand, refer to specific, executable procedures participants perform in the survey. This could involve: pressure to spend all credits or stay within budget~($N=6$), fears that final vote choices did not reflect true preferences($N=5$), or concerns that they had finished the task inefficiently~($N=6$).


\subsubsection{Social Responsibility}
Social responsibility-based concerns around performance came up when participants reflected on how their final vote counts would be perceived by others~(\smallquote{S041}{I don't want people to think that I just like don't care about <ethnicity> people at all}) or influence real-world decision-making~(\smallquote{S027}{Some of these things might \ldots have outcomes that I didn't foresee}).

All groups cited social responsibility as source to evaluate effort. Raw NASA-TLX scores~(Figure~\ref{fig:performance_cog_score}) show participants had indistinguishable performance scores. This aligns with the interview results where most participants felt positive about their final submission. 

To dig deeper, we also analyzed participants' language when they described their performance. Expressions like ``good enough'' may be indicative of satisficing behaviors -- our results suggest participants are satisfied at similar rates regardless of the interface. 1/4 of the participants in the text interface expressed ``done their best,'' referring to exhausting their effort. Participants who used a two-phase interface were generally more positive about their final outcome -- they were twice as likely to report "feeling good" about their final results~($N=11$ v.s. $N=6$).

\section{Additional voting behavior data}
\label{apdx:additional_results_behavior}
The reason why we decided to focus on the percentage of remaining credits comes from prior literature `scarcity frames value'~\cite{Shah2015a}, a driver that makes researchers believe makes quadratic voting more accurate~\cite{chengCanShowWhat2021}. We did not follow ~\textcite{quarfoot2017quadratic} in counting accumulated votes over time due to varying total times across individuals.

In this section, we complement the main text, showing a few additional figures. Figure~\ref{apdxfig:voting_all} follows the main text, showing all the voting actions over the remaining credit for the four experiment conditions. Here we see two distinct patterns between the short survey and the long survey in terms of participant behaviors. In long surveys, participants exhibited more actions both when the budget was abundant and when it began to run out. This pattern was more pronounced with the long two-phase interface. This difference is why we further focused on the long QS group.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{content/image/results/clickstream_action_distribution.pdf}
    \caption{This plot counts the number of voting actions when there are $x$ percentages of credits remaining. A KDE plot is provided to help better understand the action distribution.}
    \Description{A four-panel histogram showing the number of voting actions across remaining credit percentages for four interface versions: Short Text, Short 2-Phase, Long Text, and Long 2-Phase. Each panel displays the number of actions on the y-axis and remaining credit on the x-axis, with an overlaid KDE curve representing density. In the top panels (Short Text and Short 2-Phase), actions are distributed relatively evenly, with small peaks around 10-20\% and 50\% remaining credit. The KDE curves show minor fluctuations. In the bottom panels (Long Text and Long 2-Phase), there are more pronounced peaks at 0-10\% and 100\% remaining credit, with broader distributions and smoother KDE curves indicating denser actions around these areas. The Long Text and Long 2-Phase interfaces exhibit more actions overall compared to the Short Text and Short 2-Phase interfaces.}
    \label{apdxfig:voting_all}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{content/image/results/combined_density_plots.pdf}
    \caption{This plot further separates participants' interaction behavior based on the number of votes participants adjusted. We observed a bimodal interaction pattern across long QS when small vote adjustments are made.}
    \Description{A four-panel plot comparing the time to take action in seconds over remaining credit percentages for large and small vote adjustments in the Long Text and Long 2-Phase interfaces. Each panel includes scattered points and an overlaid KDE curve. The top left panel shows large vote adjustments for the Long Text interface, with peaks in the KDE curve around 20\% and 80\% remaining credit. The top right panel shows large vote adjustments for the Long 2-Phase interface, with two peaks in the KDE curve around 10\% and 100\%. The bottom left panel shows small vote adjustments for the Long Text interface, with scattered points and peaks in the KDE curve around 10\% and 90\%. The bottom right panel shows small vote adjustments for the Long 2-Phase interface, with a KDE curve peaking around 10\% and 100\% remaining credit. Box plots on the right side of each panel summarize the distribution of time taken to adjust votes for each interface.}    
    \label{apdxfig:voting_v3_v4}
\end{figure}

In addition to the small adjustment plots presented in Figure~\ref{fig:small_clicks}, Figure~\ref{apdxfig:voting_v3_v4} presents the comparison between when participants make small or large vote adjustments at different budget levels. Revisiting the KDE curve in the second row in Figure~\ref{apdxfig:voting_all} and the curve of the second row in Figure~\ref{apdxfig:voting_v3_v4} show a stronger bimodal distribution for small vote adjustments across interfaces. In fact, the bimodal distribution is more pronounced in the two-phase interface. This suggests that participants make small adjustments both at the beginning and toward the end of the QS. However, the two-phase interface shows more frequent and faster edits towards the end. In comparison, participants also made more large vote adjustments early on that spread more equally compared to the text interface. This indicates that participants had a clearer idea of how to distribute their credits across the options.

\section{Voting Interfaces and Response Format}

Research in the marketing and research communities focusing on survey and questionnaire design, usability, and interactions examines the influence of presentation styles and `response format.'~\textcite{weijtersExtremityHorizontalVertical2021} demonstrated that horizontal distances between options are more influential than vertical distances, with the latter recommended for reduced bias. Slider bars, which operate on a drag-and-drop principle, show lower mean scores and higher nonresponse rates compared to buttons, indicating they are more prone to bias and difficult to use. In contrast, visual analog scales that operate on a point-and-click principle perform better~\cite{toepoelSlidersVisualAnalogue2018}. These studies show how even small design changes can have a large impact on usability, highlighting the importance of designing interfaces that prioritize human-centered interaction rather than focusing solely on functionality.

Voting interfaces are a specialized type of survey interface that not only elicit individual choices but often have consequential impacts. For example, the butterfly ballot, an atypical design, may have influenced the outcome of the 2000 U.S. Presidential Election~\cite{wandButterflyDidIt2001}. Research has shown that ballot interfaces can significantly influence democratic processes~\cite{engstrom2020politics, chisnellDemocracyDesignProblem2016, DesigningUsableBallots2015}. Several studies also highlighted how voting interface designs shift voter decisions~\cite{engstrom2020politics}, reduce usability errors~\cite{quesenberyOpinionGoodDesign2020, everettElectronicVotingMachines2008}, or improve interaction~\cite{leeUniversalDesignBallot2016, summers2014making, dawkinsPrimeIIIInnovative2009, gilbertAnomalyDetectionElectronic2013, conradElectronicVotingEliminates2009}. We provide more details to these voting interfaces in the Appendix~\ref{apdx:relatedVoting}.

From the QV implementations, response format literature, and voting interfaces, we identified how interfaces significantly influence respondent behavior, decision accuracy, and cognitive load. While these systems are functional, they lack the human-centered design needed to reduce cognitive load and make them truly usable, rather than simply operable. These burdens are especially problematic for complex systems like QS, where high cognitive demands may deter researchers and users alike. Developing effective, human-centered interfaces for QS could enhance usability, reduce cognitive overload, and increase adoption in both research and practical applications.
