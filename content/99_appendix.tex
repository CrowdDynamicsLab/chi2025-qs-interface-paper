\section{Cognitive Demand Tables}
Here we provide the full qualitative analysis table.

\subsection{Mental Demand Table}
\label{apdx:mental_table}
\begin{table}[h]
   \caption{This table lists all the causes participants mentioned as contributing to their Mental Demand. The shaded cells represent the percentage of participants citing each source of mental demand, allowing for comparison within columns. The abbreviations are: ST (Short Text Interface), SI (Short Two-phase Interface), LT (Long Text Interface), and LI (Long Two-phase Interface). Short and Long refer to the sum across both interfaces; Text and Inter refer to the sum across both survey lengths. We include Sparklines for comparisons across these experiment groups.}

\end{table}

\subsection{Physical Demand Table}
\label{apdx:physical_table}
\begin{table}[H]
    \caption{Physical Demand Causes: Most participants expressed little or no physical demand. Results reflected that participants in the long two-phase interface required more actions, hence the higher mention of mouse usage as a source.}
    \label{tbl:physical}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{content/image/cog/physical_table.png}
\end{table}

\subsection{Performance Table}
\label{apdx:perf_table}
\begin{table}[H]
    \caption{Performance Causes: Most causes are shared across experiment conditions. We provided qualitative interpretations of their own perfornace assessments.}
    \label{tbl:physical}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{content/image/cog/perf_table.png}
\end{table}

\subsection{Temporal Demand Table}
\label{apdx:temporal_table}
\begin{table}[H]
    \caption{Temporal Demand Sources: Decision-making and Operational Tasks are the main causes. Participants framed their decision-making sources differently.}
    \label{tbl:temporal}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{content/image/cog/temporal_table.png}
\end{table}

\subsection{Frustration Table}
\label{apdx:frus_table}
\begin{table}[H]
    \caption{Frustration Sources: needs to be updated with some new terms definitions for some of the columns.}
