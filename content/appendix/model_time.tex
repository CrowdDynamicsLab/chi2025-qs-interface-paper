\section{Modeling Total Time} \label{sec:apdx:model_time}

\subsection{Dependent Variables} The dependent variable is the total time $T_i$ spent on option $i$ measured in seconds. This measure captures both the duration participants took to vote and, where applicable, the time they spent organizing or reordering their options beforehand. We categorize the data into four experimental conditions: Short Text, Short Two-Phase, Long Text, and Long Two-Phase. These conditions are indexed by $k$, fit using separate submodels.

\subsection{Modeling Approach} We modeled the total time for each experimental condition using separate Gamma likelihood models. The Gamma distribution is well-suited for modeling positive continuous data, such as time measurements, which are often skewed and strictly positive. Equation~\ref{eq:time_main} shows the model for the total time. The shape parameter $\alpha_k$ and rate parameter $\beta_k$ were each assigned priors drawn from their own Gamma distributions, as described in Equations~\ref{eq:alpha_prior} and \ref{eq:beta_prior}.

\begin{align}
    T_i &\sim \text{Gamma}(\alpha_k, \beta_k) \label{eq:time_main} \\
    \alpha_k &\sim \text{Gamma}(2.0, 0.5) \label{eq:alpha_prior} \\
    \beta_k &\sim \text{Gamma}(1.0, 1.0) \label{eq:beta_prior}
\end{align}
