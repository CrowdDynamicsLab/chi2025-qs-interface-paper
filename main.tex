\begin{abstract}
This study introduces a new two-phase interface for Quadratic Surveys (QS) designed to scaffold users' decision-making process in order to better manage the cognitive load associated with QS's complexity. QS's complexity has greatly hindered its widespread adoption in surveying the public's opinions on societal issues for collective decision-making, despite its ability to elicit more accurate individual preferences compared to traditional surveys like the Likert-scale surveys as prior CSCW research has shown. Prior work shows that survey interface design significantly influences results and accuracy. To realize QS's full potential, we iteratively designed a two-phase ``organize-then-vote'' two-phase interface for QS based on decision-making and preference construction theories. Through a 2x2 between-subject in-lab study in a public resource allotment decision context, we compared this novel interface with a traditional text interface across two QSs with different lengths, one short (6 options) and one long (24 options). We found that our two-phase interface reduced participants' satisficing behaviors caused by cognitive overload in long QS conditions. In addition, we noted a shift in participants' cognitive effort from operating QS to constructing more comprehensive preferences when participants used our two-phase interface for long QS. This research contributes to CSCW by demonstrating how human-centered digital interface design can enhance the effectiveness of preference elicitation tools in collective decision-making on societal issues.

%A two-phase interface scaffolds individual decision making process in long QS, shifting cognitive effort from operating the survey tool to constructing more comprehensive preferences.
